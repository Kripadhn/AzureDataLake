Azure Data Lake includes two main components: Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) and Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA).

1. Azure Data Lake Storage (ADLS) is a scalable and secure data lake that allows you to store big data in its raw and refined forms. You can store data as files and directories in a hierarchical manner, allowing you to manage data at any scale.

2. Azure Data Lake Analytics (ADLA) is a cloud-based service that provides a simple, flexible, and powerful way to analyze big data. It allows you to process big data at scale using Azure Data Lake Storage as a storage backend.

3. Azure Databricks: A fast, easy, and collaborative Apache Spark-based analytics platform that enables you to process big data at scale.

4. Azure HDInsight: A cloud-based service that makes it easy to process big data using popular open-source frameworks such as Hadoop, Spark, Hive, and others.

5. Azure Stream Analytics: A real-time stream processing service that allows you to analyze and act on data from various sources in real-time.

6. Azure Machine Learning: A cloud-based service that provides a simple, scalable, and secure platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning models.

7. Power BI: A business intelligence tool that allows you to visualize and share data insights. You can connect Power BI to Azure Data Lake Storage and perform interactive data exploration and visualization on big data.
